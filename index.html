                    <p>I’m a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate with a strong passion for 
                        building meaningful and creative software. Over the course of my studies, 
                        I’ve developed a wide range of projects — from games to utility software — 
                        that have sharpened my skills in C++ and Python. I enjoy solving complex problems, 
                        learning new technologies, and turning ideas into real, functional code.</p>

                    <p>This is a project I worked on for my AI course. I implemented an A*
                        search algorithm to solve Sudoku. There were many challenges that 
                        that came with it including figuring out heuristic costs. We used 
                        a skeleton for the GUI and everything was written using Python.

                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>The main idea I had behind the algorithm implementation 
                        was that having some heuristic cost that would help figure out which
                        empty cells should be prioritized first. I used possible canidates 
                        for an empty cell as its heuristic cost so prioritize those with fewer
                        possible options.
