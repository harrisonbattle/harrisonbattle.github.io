If you would like to check out my code for my website, please open all files to in your desired IDE.

I have my images inside of the project folder and everything contained in one HTML file, one CSS file, and one JS file.

You can locally run the website without connection to the internet by copying the address from your IDE for the project and running it on your default web browser.


If you are looking to run my project I provided, my A* Sudoku Search Bot, there will be a few dependicies needed.

You can always just clone the repo from my provided link and run the evaluation.py file to see a some what polished terminal representation of the solver working.
The evaluation.py file will use both a backtracking and my A* serach algorithm and show the time differences. If you want to run the full GUI, you will need pygame 
and a few other dependencies that are provided in the files for the project.
